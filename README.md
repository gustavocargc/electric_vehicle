Prediction of energy consumption in electric cars
A transportation and logistics company wants to migrate its fleet to electric cars in order to reduce costs.

Before making the decision, the company would like to predict the energy consumption of electric cars based on various usage factors and vehicle characteristics.

I must build a Machine Learning model capable of predicting the energy consumption of electric cars based on various factors, such as the type and number of electric motors in the vehicle, vehicle weight, load capacity, among other attributes.

The goal is to create a Machine Learning model with a maximum of 15% MAPE. (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).
